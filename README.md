<h1>Hi, I'm Ayush Gairola </h1>
I build agentic AI systems and full-stack applications. Currently working on AntiNode AI - a multi-source reasoning engine with self-correcting agents.

 <h2>What I'm Building</h2>
AntiNode AI - Multi-source agentic reasoning platform

Built custom agent orchestration (no LangChain) with self-verification loops
10+ specialized tools for knowledge retrieval and validation
Confidence-based retry logic to reduce hallucinations
Real-time streaming UX with event-driven architecture
Tech: React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Anthropic API

<h2>Notable Projects</h2>

-Custom LLM agent framework in pure JavaScript.
-Self-correcting tool-use system with dynamic re-planning.
-Internal document analysis, retrieval, rag, web-crawl and web search tools.
